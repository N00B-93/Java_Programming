Design a class hierarchy consisting of Publication , Magazine , Book , and
KidsMagazine classes as follows:

 A Publication has a publisher, number of pages, a price, and a title. The class
should implement a print method that displays all of this information.

 A Magazine is a kind of publication that has a publication unit (monthly, weekly,
biweekly). Magazine should override the print method of Publication and display
all the new information.

 A Book is a kind of publication that has an author. Book should also override the
print method of Publication .

 A KidsMagazine is a kind of magazine that has a recommended age range.
Again, KidsMagazine should override the print method of Publication.

Implement a test class that stores 10 different types of publications: general,
magazine, book, or kidâ€™s magazine in an array of Publication . Exploit polymorphism
and print the information, sorted by title, about each object stored in the array.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a record of my journey in learning Java. As I progress, I'll be adding more directories covering various topics in the future.

## Concepts

Here's a brief overview of the Java concepts included in this repository:

1. **Elementary Programming**: Basic operations like arithmetic, input/output, and variable assignment.
2. **Selections**: Using conditions (if-else, switch) to execute specific blocks of code based on certain criteria.
3. **Mathematical Functions, Characters and Strings**:  Operations and manipulations involving numbers, characters, and strings.
4. **Loops**: Repeating a block of code until a certain condition is met (for, while, do-while).
5. **Methods**: Encapsulating blocks of code into reusable functions with parameters and return values.
6. **Single Dimensional Arrays**: Storing and accessing a collection of elements of the same type in a linear fashion.
7. **Multidimensional Arrays**: Arrays with more than one dimension, like matrices or tables.
8. **Objects And Classes**: Modeling real-world entities with attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods).
9. **Abstract Classes And Interfaces**: Defining blueprints for classes and providing contracts for methods to be implemented.
10. **Exception Handling And Text I/O**: Dealing with errors and handling input/output operations.
11. **Generics**: Writing code that works with different types while maintaining type safety.
12. **Database Programming**: Interacting with databases to store and retrieve data using Java's database connectivity (JDBC) API.

## How to Use

Each program is contained in its own directory along with any necessary resources or instructions. To run a program, follow;
```bash
java fileName.java```

                    Investments—Practice with Inheritance
There are many different kinds of investments, including stocks, mutual funds, real
estate, and bank accounts. There are two kinds of bank accounts: checking and
savings.
    Design an abstract Investment class that includes a name attribute, a value attribute ( double ), and a getter
method, getValue(). The Investment class, being abstract, cannot be instantiated.
    Design subclasses: Stocks, MutualFunds, RealEstate, and BankAccount.
• The attributes of Stocks are name, pricePerShare, numberOfSharesOwned, and dividend (a percent of the investment paid annually).
• The attributes of MutualFunds are: name, pricePerShare, and numberOfSharesOwned .
• The attributes of RealEstate are: name, addressOf Property, purchasePrice, and currentAssessedValue.
• BankAccount is an abstract class that extends Investment. The name fi eld holds the bank’s name. An additional
attribute accountNumber ( String ) represents an account number.
• BankAccount has two subclasses: SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount.
• A SavingsAccount object has an annual interest rate paid quarterly. SavingsAccount
has a method addInterest() that adjusts the balance of the account.
• A CheckingAccount is-a BankAccount with a minimum balance, a penalty if the balance goes below the minimum in any
month, and an annual interest rate (paid monthly) on the money in excess of the minimum balance. Include method
addInterest(), which adds one month’s interest to the balance, and a method checkBalance() , which adjusts the balance
if the balance falls below the minimum.
    Each class that is not abstract should also include a method displayData() that prints all the information
of a particular investment, properly labeled.
    A portfolio is an array of Investment references. Implement a Portfolio class that also includes a getNetValue()
method. This method returns the sum of the values of all investments referenced by portfolio . Interactively, create a
portfolio with at least six investments, including stocks, mutual funds, real estate, and a bank account.
    Display the data for each investment along with the net value of all investments.

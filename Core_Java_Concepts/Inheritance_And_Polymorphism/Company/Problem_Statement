                        A Company and the Employee Hierarchy

This problem builds on the Employee project, exhibiting a classic example of polymorphism for the Employee hierarchy.

A Company has a name, a product, and a list of employees. That is, a Company is composed of two String references ( name and product ),
and an array of type Employee .

Design a Company class. Methods should include constructors, getters, and setters, as well as methods that:
• return a reference to an array of all the executives,
• return a reference to an array of all the managers who are not executives,
• return a reference to an array of all the employees who are neither managers nor executives, and
• return the sum of the salaries of all employees.

Include a main(...) method that tests the class. Your application should query the user for the name, product, and employee
information. The user should indicate whether each employee is a manager or an executive, and it should include salary and other
relevant information. The test class should display:
• the company name,
• company product,
• three lists of names and salaries:
• executives,
• managers (who are not executives), and
• employees (who are neither managers nor executives),
• the sum of the salaries for each list,
• and the sum of all the salaries of all employees.
